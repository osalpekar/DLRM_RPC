For running single node experiments, run the following:
`python driver.py`

You can explore the options by passing the `--help` flag.
Use the `--use-gpu` flag to run the experiments on GPUs.
Certain flags have been set by default in the driver.py `main()` function for ease of experimentation.

For running multi-node experiments, a launcher script has been provided in `train.sh`.
To use this, you must change change set the number of nodes you wish to use, the address of the master node, the total number of trainer processes desired, and the network interface TensorPipe should us.
Then you can simply run the following on each node:
`./train.sh <node_rank>`

where <node_rank> is a unique rank for each node (0 ... num_nodes-1).
